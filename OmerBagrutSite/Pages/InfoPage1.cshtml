        <h2>The Science Behind Pre-Workout Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Your body primarily uses glycogen (stored carbohydrates in the muscles) and glucose (sugar in the blood) for energy. When glycogen levels are low due to poor nutrition or fasting, you may experience early fatigue, poor focus, and reduced strength. By fueling properly, you ensure your muscles and brain are primed for peak performance.</p>

        <h2>Timing Is Everything</h2>
        <p>There’s no one-size-fits-all. Use this guide as a rule of thumb:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2–3 hours before:</strong> Ideal for a full, balanced meal</li>
            <li><strong>1 hour before:</strong> A light meal or large snack</li>
            <li><strong>30 minutes before:</strong> A small snack, easy to digest</li>
            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Water, sports drink, or small carb bite (banana, energy gel)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Eat Before Working Out</h2>
        <p>Pre-workout meals should prioritize carbohydrates and moderate protein, and avoid high-fat or high-fiber foods that slow digestion.</p>

        <h3>Balanced Pre-Workout Meal Ideas:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole-grain wrap with chicken and spinach</li>
            <li>Oats with banana, whey protein, and cinnamon</li>
            <li>Rice bowl with tofu and roasted vegetables</li>
            <li>Sweet potato + boiled eggs + avocado (in small portions)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Quick Snack Options (when short on time):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy balls (oats + honey + peanut butter)</li>
            <li>Plain toast with jam</li>
            <li>Rice cakes with nut butter</li>
            <li>Fruit smoothie with Greek yogurt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Don’t Forget Hydration</h2>
        <p>Dehydration is a hidden performance killer. Even mild dehydration (1–2%) can reduce endurance and strength. Sip water throughout the day, and drink 250–500 ml (8–17 oz) in the hour before exercise.</p>

        <h2>Personalization Tips</h2>
        <p>Every athlete is different. Keep a food journal to track:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What you ate</li>
            <li>How you felt during training</li>
            <li>How your stomach responded</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This helps you develop your own ideal fueling routine over time.</p>
