        <h2>Mistake 1: Skipping Meals (Especially Post-Workout)</h2>
        <p>
            You might think you're saving calories or giving your body a “break,” but in reality, skipping meals—
            especially after a workout—limits your recovery and can increase muscle breakdown.
        </p>
        <h3>Why It’s Harmful:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blood sugar crashes = fatigue and brain fog</li>
            <li>Slowed muscle repair</li>
            <li>Increased cravings later</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>Build a habit: Within 30–60 minutes of training, eat a snack or meal with carbs and protein.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 2: Underestimating the Power of Carbs</h2>
        <p>
            Carbs aren’t the enemy—they’re fuel. Many athletes reduce carbs thinking it will help with fat loss,
            but instead, they hit energy walls mid-workout.
        </p>
        <h3>What You Need to Know:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbs replenish muscle glycogen</li>
            <li>Low carb = low endurance</li>
            <li>Brain uses glucose for decision-making and coordination</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>Include slow-digesting carbs in every meal: oats, brown rice, fruit, sweet potatoes.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 3: Relying Too Heavily on Supplements</h2>
        <p>
            Supplements are tools—not foundations. Overuse of shakes, powders, and pills often leads to missing key
            nutrients found in whole foods.
        </p>
        <h3>Reality Check:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Real food offers fiber, antioxidants, and diverse nutrients</li>
            <li>Whole meals are more satisfying and nourishing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>Use supplements when convenient, but aim for at least 80% of protein and nutrients from whole foods.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 4: Poor Hydration Strategy</h2>
        <p>Waiting until you're thirsty is too late. Dehydration affects strength, coordination, and recovery.</p>
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start the day with water</li>
            <li>Drink 200–300ml every 20 minutes during intense exercise</li>
            <li>Add electrolytes when training for over 1 hour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mistake 5: No Nutrition Plan</h2>
        <p>
            Winging it doesn't work. Without structure, you’re more likely to skip meals, grab low-quality snacks, or underfuel.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prep meals/snacks ahead</li>
            <li>Set reminders to eat and hydrate</li>
            <li>Keep “go-to” meals handy (e.g., tuna wrap, smoothie packs, overnight oats)</li>
        </ul>
